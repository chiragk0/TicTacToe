1.  The game ticactoe.py is intended to be run on the built-in command line/terminal on any OS, an IDE,
Python interactive mode, or the file manager of your system
2.  This program is a simple two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game that implements some of the Python fundamentals(variables,loops,expressions).
3.  After the program is run, a defaulted Player 1 is asked whether they want to be X or O, representing the two
respective players of the game. 
4.  Upon starting the game, each player chooses a number from 1 to 9 that matches the
numbers' respective space on the board.
5.  The game continues until one of the players manages to occupy a whole row,
column, or diagonal space. 
6.  If none of the players manage to accomplish this, the game ends in a draw. Once the game ends,
a recursive loop prompts the defaulted player 1 the options to play again or exit.
